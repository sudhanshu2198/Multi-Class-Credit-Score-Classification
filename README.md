# Multi-Class Credit Score Classification

Credit score is designed to represent your creditworthiness, or how likely you are to repay a lender on time. Potential lenders and creditors look at your credit score as one factor when deciding whether to offer you new credit. Lenders may also use your credit score to set the interest rates and other terms for any credit they offer.

Your credit score is calculated using the information found on your credit report. Your payment history, the mix of credit accounts you have, the length of your credit history and your credit utilization rate (the percentage of available credit limits you are using) are all factors that might influence your credit scores.

**The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict credit score given credit related information..**
